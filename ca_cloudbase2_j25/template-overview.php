<h2>CloudBase 2.0 Presets</h2>

<p>Presets are a pre-defined set of values that can be applied across any of the configuration settings for this theme.
    The Presets Panel can be opened by clicking on 'Presets' on the top right of the screen, clicking a preset option is
    akin to clicking a preset button on your car radio, it effectively sets the preset values in all the fields and you
    can tweak and apply those settings. You can also 'Save Custom Preset as New' to create your own preset.</p>
<h2>Overview of the Gantry Framework</h2>

<p>Gantry is a sophisticated framework with the sole intention of being the best platform to build a solid theme with.
    Gantry takes all the lessons learned during the development of many RocketTheme Joomla templates and WordPress
    Themes and distills that knowledge into a single super-flexible framework that is easy to configure, simple to
    extend, and powerful enough to handle anything we want to throw at it.</p>
